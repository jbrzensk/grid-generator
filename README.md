# Grid Generator
This will bet he repository for Aneesh's work on deveoping a grid generator, which will make 3D curvilinear meshes sufficiently smooth to use in numerical simulations.

## Features
Features ofthe grid generator will be:
- Metric for smoothness
- Optimal smoothing algorithm
- User interface
- Ability to refine the grid in a region ( internal points, along edges ... )
